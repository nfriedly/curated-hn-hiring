We recognize that we each have lives,\n    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and &gt; 40 hour weeks are\n    rare by design.\n\n  - We&#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.\n\n  - We offer competitive salaries, health&#x2F;vision&#x2F;dental insurance, quarterly profit\n    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office\n    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nA little bit about Grand Rapids:<\/p><p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.\n\n  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in\n    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a \u201cWorld Class\u201d bar on BA.\n    Just look here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;beeradvocate.com&#x2F;beerfly&#x2F;city&#x2F;43\n\n  - If you\u2019re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,\n    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment\n    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.\n\n  - A growing technology and startup community.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nA little bit about you:<\/p><p><pre><code>  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.\n\n  - You learn new stuff quickly. You\u2019ve used a lot of technologies, but you\u2019re not\n    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.\n\n  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.\n\n  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.\n<\/code><\/pre>\nI&#x27;m a software craftsman on this awesome team. If you&#x27;re interested, send me your resume&#x2F;CV and a little bit about why you\u2019re interested:<\/p><p>ej@mutuallyhuman.com<\/p><\/font>",

In October 2012, we acquired the design firm 80&#x2F;20 and have had New York based colleagues for some time now. Our logical next step was to bootstrap a NYC Engineering presence to tap in the growing community here. We just started building the Engineering team in July.<\/p><p>As a company, we have four main focuses.<\/p><p>Go international. We&#x27;re adapting what made us successful in the US abroad. This is harder than typical international plays since it requires translating our four major benefits to small merchants: 1. Shipping readers, 2. Card payments (physical world is much more complex than online), 3. Sending money quickly to our merchants, a.k.a. settlement: very localized and next-day is hard on a number of fronts), 4. Assessing risk of merchants as they sign up, aka underwriting: again, very localized most countries do have FICO scores, SSN, D&amp;B numbers and such.<\/p><p>Move up market. One of the biggest success of Square is to have enabled merchants who were &quot;non-consumers&quot; to start accepting credit cards. In classic disruptor fashion, we have essentially alonged the long tail. We haven&#x27;t been eating someone else&#x27;s lunch, we&#x27;ve created a whole new category! Now it&#x27;s time to move up to bigger merchants.<\/p><p>The other side of the counter. With Wallet, Square Market (<a href=\"http:\/\/squareup.com\/market\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;squareup.com&#x2F;market<\/a>) and Square Cash (<a href=\"http:\/\/squareup.com\/cash\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;squareup.com&#x2F;cash<\/a>), we&#x27;re going on the other side of the counter and interacting directly with consumers. We think that we can provide the best experience for consumer-to-merchant and consumer-to-consumer commerce. We&#x27;re at the infancy, but extremely well positioned to succeed.<\/p><p>Data as product. We&#x27;re leveraging our data. We know a lot about our merchants: daily sales, seasonality, growth of their business, correlation with other events (e.g. Mapping Square Payments During the Super Bowl). Lots of innovative products are in the making which will highlight the breadth of what we do.<\/p><p>In NYC, we&#x27;re starting with a focus on infrastructure, distributed systems, and money moving systems. We&#x27;re a small team, located in SoHo, and defining the culture of engineering for Square on the East Coast.<\/p><p>If you&#x27;re interested; I&#x27;d love to chat. Shoot me an e-mail with your resume! seantabor@squareup.com<\/p><\/font>",

We have roughly 4,000 R&amp;D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level &quot;app&quot; development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we&#x27;re evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We&#x27;re helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we&#x27;ve rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.<\/p><p>All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we&#x27;re a tiny percentage of the overall R&amp;D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC&#x27;s Python-files-must-be-included rules.<\/p><p>We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion &quot;ticks&quot; daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one &quot;feed&quot;) from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication&#x2F;subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.<\/p><p>Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)<\/p><p>We could use a motto like &quot;We do a lot of stuff.&quot;<\/p><p>Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com. If you want to chat in person, we are a sustaining sponsor of NYTM and are at all the meetups. I&#x27;ll be sponsoring &#x2F; attending RobotsConf in December, too.<\/p><\/font>",

Our customers include some of the most well-known brands in the world and many, many digital agencies.<\/p><p>We\u2019ve just scratched the surface of the things we can do to help our customers, and we think we can grow at a much faster rate if we keep delivering on our roadmap. We need your help getting there.<\/p><p>WHAT WE\u2019RE LOOKING FOR: We\u2019re looking for mid to senior level  software engineers, but we\u2019re much less concerned about the specific level of experience than we are in finding people with the right attitude, ability to learn, and approach to solving problems.  Part of our team works remotely, and we\u2019re open to remote work for this position for the right person.<\/p><p>Our app is written in Java, deployed on Amazon\u2019s cloud and utilizes several open source dependencies.  Expert knowledge of Java and Linux are required. Experience with AWS and modern javascript technologies is a plus.<\/p><p>BuzzStream may be a good fit for you if...<\/p><p>* You want to work at a place where virtually everything you work on impacts the business and you know exactly how everything you build helps the customer.<\/p><p>* You don\u2019t want to be pigeon-holed as \u201cthe guy&#x2F;girl who works on the [XYZ] part of the product.\u201d You\u2019ll be working on every part of the product and you\u2019ll constantly be learning.<\/p><p>* It\u2019s really important to you to work on a team where every person cares deeply about building great software that solves real problems.  You have no use for bureaucracy, pointless meetings, or team members that provide limited value but succeed as a result of fake hustle and strong political skills.<\/p><p>* You really want to learn what it takes to build a startup, but you\u2019d rather not learn through the \u201cI learned what not to do\u201d method. We\u2019ve made plenty of mistakes, but we\u2019re past the stage of trying to figure out how to build a successful business.<\/p><p>If this sounds like something you\u2019re interested in, I\u2019d love to hear from you. Please send me a resume, along with a note telling me a bit about yourself and why you\u2019re interested in BuzzStream. You can reach me (Paul May, co-founder) at careers@buzzstream.com.<\/p><\/font>",

We are a very small team (I am the only employee) and want to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and&#x2F;or on infrastructure. No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<\/p><p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<\/p><p>Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/amacapital.net\/careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;amacapital.net&#x2F;careers.html<\/a> to learn more, and send applications&#x2F;inquiries to careers@amacapital.net.<\/p><\/font>",

Since being founded in 2009 by recent Cambridge and UCL graduates who noticed a gap in the market when making their own leavers&#x27; yearbook, we have had considerable success: over the past two years our sales have grown more than tenfold and we are now the market leader in the UK. After a particularly successful academic year in 2012-2013, we\u2019re expanding our development team and are now looking for an ambitious Junior &#x2F; Graduate Developer to help us to continue to grow.<\/p><p>Your job will involve working on many different aspects of our software and technology systems. We\u2019ve managed to automate a highly complex design process, allowing us to create customised book layouts at the push of a button. This has involved bringing together many of the latest and most exciting software technologies and combining them in new ways to build a genuinely innovative piece of engineering. While we won\u2019t expect you to understand it all straight away, you\u2019ll be given the freedom to work on whichever parts of the system most interest you, and will be supported by the rest of the development team in learning the best practices of modern software engineering. This will include opportunities to get involved with: front-end development using the latest OOP JavaScript frameworks, back-end development, DevOps and automated server provisioning using Chef and Vagrant, automated testing, continuous integration and automated layout design.<\/p><p>Working at Yearbook Machine is not the corporate grind: we\u2019re a small group of like-minded, focused individuals working to create a product we genuinely believe in. We work hard but our environment is relaxed and friendly. Our office is based in a light and airy converted warehouse in central Shoreditch, which we share with another design startup. We&#x27;re currently a team of just 6 people, 5 of whom are developers.<\/p><p>Requirements<\/p><p><pre><code>  - 2:1 above in Computer Science or other similarly technical degree subject\n  - Experience with OOP and at least some knowledge of modern software development paradigms such as MVC\n  - A genuine passion for technology: we\u2019ll be interested to see what you\u2019ve been doing in your spare time!\n<\/code><\/pre>\nBenefits<\/p><p><pre><code>  - Highly competitive, above-market salary\n  - Generous stock options\n  - The best equipment: Your choice of computer and monitor(s) and a comfortable chair\n  - Job satisfaction: we make a product that is fun to build and that our customers love!\n<\/code><\/pre>\nTo apply, please email your CV and cover letter to jobs@yearbookmachine.com with the subject \u201cGraduate &#x2F; Junior PHP Developer\u201d<\/p><\/font>",

We use a 3rd party service when it&#x27;s cost efficient and sufficiently flexible and build stand-alone in house services when that makes the most sense.

Our product and business model are proving to be quite disruptive in a very large market. Companies like Netflix, Priceline.com, Deutsche Bank, Williams Sonoma, Betfair and Expedia are using AppDynamics to ensure the performance and availability of their revenue-critical applications.<\/p><p>AppDynamics&#x27; traditional products for JVM, CLR, PHP and Node.js kick ass at measuring server-side performance across your app. But with the shift to highly interactive websites and mobile apps, an increasing number of performance problems are caused by client-side code or internet latency. End-User Monitoring measures the performance that your real users&#x27; experience by instrumenting client-side platform APIs. EUM complements server-side monitoring, but comes with its own set of challenges:<\/p><p>* Client-side platforms are not designed for easy instrumentation. How can we extract meaningful performance data from web browsers, iOS, and Android?<\/p><p>* Client-side performance performance is confounded by the huge variability in devices, workloads, and network latency. How can we make sense of this complex, noisy, multi-dimensional data?<\/p><p>* How can we cope with the volume of performance data flooding in from millions&#x2F;billions of users?<\/p><p>* How can we incorporate client-side and server-side data into a complete picture of app performance?<\/p><p>Here are the components of our system, and what it takes to work on them:<\/p><p>Browser Agent:<\/p><p>* Write fast, bulletproof instrumentation for JavaScript that can run inside any web app across hundreds of browser versions.<\/p><p>* Understand behavioral and performance idiosyncrasies of various browsers.<\/p><p>* Incorporate new timing specifications from W3C performance working group, but develop fallback timing techniques for other browsers.<\/p><p>Mobile Agents:<\/p><p>* Build fast, bulletproof instrumentation for iOS (Objective-C) and Android (Java) platform APIs that can run inside any app across thousands of devices.<\/p><p>* Understand mobile app architecture and frameworks, identify strategies to extract user actions, performance and system crash data.<\/p><p>* Understand iOS, Android, and Dalvik internals, and the characteristics and constraints of mobile platforms in general.<\/p><p>Cloud:<\/p><p>* This is the processing platform that receives data from the agents. It&#x27;s a scalable data processor and analytics engine (think real-time map&#x2F;reduce) built on Amazon Web Services.<\/p><p>* Process billions of end-user requests from some of the biggest sites in the world.<\/p><p>* Scale with AWS infrastructure components (EC2, S3, DynamoDB, EMR, etc).<\/p><p>* Ensure zero downtime, zero data loss, continuous deployment, multi tenant, multi \nversion, etc.<\/p><p>* Analyze huge volumes of data with statistical techniques, machine learning, predictive analysis.<\/p><p>UI:<\/p><p>* Design and build learnable, usable, data-rich HTML5 UI that helps users discover, triage, and root-cause performance problems.<\/p><p>* We use AngularJS and TypeScript.<\/p><p>I work in the EUM team and we are looking to expand.

The circuit is built almost entirely in the Go language with occasional appearances of C and C++. It spans the entire lifecycle of an application, from development to execution and sustanance. It comprises technologies like compilers, interpreters, optimizers, low-level operating system management, distributed resource sharing, information flow, security, and many others. The Go Circuit is, by design, open source.<\/p><p>The goal of the circuit is to enable the possibility of encoding an entire Internet company&#x27;s infrastructure in a single executable, which can be revived with a single click on an ice-cold cluster of empty hardware and can sustain itself indefinitely, without human involvement, short of the requisite replacement of hardware now and again.<\/p><p>The demonstrated, over the past year, power of the circuit environment has compelled industry, academic and government institutions to sponsor the project and become involved with large-scale deployments. We are, henceforth, expanding.<\/p><p>RESPONSIBILITIES<\/p><p>Full-time and internship candidates have identical responsibilities.<\/p><p>Systems Engineers will work alongside the founding system architect on all aspects of the technology: design, implementation, testing, fixing bugs, writing integration drivers, documentation and research. All of their work will be open-sourced. Almost all code will be written in Go, however, other languages like Python, C, C++, Lua, JavaScript, etc. will make a presence.<\/p><p>System Engineers will be researchers as well. In designing the semantic and linguistic interfaces of the circuit, we investigate past and present, scientific and industrial, literature and software on a wide range of algorithmic topics to help us inform and verify our choices.<\/p><p>QUALIFICATIONS<\/p><p>The ideal candidate, full-time and internship, would meet the following criteria, or demonstrate an equivalent level of technical sophistication:<\/p><p>* Full-time candidates should have B.A.&#x2F;B.Sc., M.A.&#x2F;M.Sc. or Ph.D. in some hard science. Internship candidates, who are near the completion of their studies towards the mentioned degrees, are also elligible.<\/p><p>* Four or more years of experience with a low-level&#x2F;systems programming language like C, C++, or Java as well as some experience in building systems, small or big alike, is quite desirable. Altenratively, a serious involvement with a more exotic concurrent or research language, like Haskell or Erlang, would work as well.<\/p><p>* Having a non-trivial open-source project (in any language) would be highly valued.<\/p><p>* Some understanding of how UNIX operating kernels and systems work on the inside. (You don&#x27;t need to be a specialist.)<\/p><p>* Knowledge of current industrial open-source technologies is good albeit not a deal-breaker. However, interest and desire to learn and hack some of them will be needed.<\/p><p>* Ability to read academic publications in Computer Science<\/p><p>Most importantly, we are looking for individuals who are able and willing to learn fast and have open flexible minds. On that note, we do not expect that you have prior Go experience, however we do expect that<\/p><p>* Candidates will come prepared to carry out the interview in Go.<\/p><p>We are not going to test your Go-intricacies skills. We simply expect that you be able to implement your solutions to our programming riddles in Go.<\/p><p>COMPENSATION<\/p><p>Compensation will vary based on experience as we welcome both out-of-college engineers and seasoned industry scientists. That said, compensation and benefits will be on par with the standard amongst institutions like Google, IBM, Microsoft and such.\nLocation<\/p><p>To apply, please, send your vitae and anything else you want to say to Petar at p@gocircuit.org.<\/p><\/font>",

The company is an early-stage startup located in Oakland\u2019s Rockridge neighborhood with initial funding from a National Science Foundation grant and a major automobile client. We use location data from vehicles to derive driving behaviors which we capture in a proprietary database. This database feeds applications in the areas of driver safety, fuel economy and autonomous vehicles.<\/p><p>We are looking for a smart, adaptable individual with plenty of skills and breadth in computing to build products from our data streams. By joining us today, you get a unique chance to engineer new technology from the ground up. Working in tandem with the company\u2019s CTO, you will tackle both back end infrastructure and a web front end. Initially, the position will primarily involve hands-on coding and systems administration, but it can evolve toward more supervision and&#x2F;or architectural work as we grow, based on your inclinations.<\/p><p>Our current systems are built 100% in Python, with a PostGIS database in the back end. Our roadmap includes two key tasks that the Director of Engineering must be equipped to lead:\n* Take the back end to the next level by splitting it into multiple databases that each fulfill a specific purpose, and shard our primary data warehouse so it can handle tens of terabytes. The choice of technologies is still to be determined, so a broad range of experience with distributed systems and nosql databases is desirable;\n* Build an interactive web front end that dynamically displays geospatial data, in the form of both maps and charts. We are looking for a track record delivering interactive web applications, experience with web maps, and good programming skills both server-side and client-side.<\/p><p>Individuals who are creative, honest, open-minded, enterprising, kind and attentionate to details will fit our team the best. The project is incredibly fun and innovative, addresses major societal challenges in the areas of public health and sustainable development, and eyes a huge market opportunity.

Ideally, this person would also have an active role in the design process as well, either leading design or working with our contract designer.<\/p><p>We&#x27;re also looking for a Director of Marketing.  Rinse is a quintessential B2C business, with plenty of opportunities for online advertising, offline collateral, partnerships, and &#x27;growth hacking.&#x27;  We&#x27;re building a scalable business model and the technology to support it, now help us scale the business.  Please see a job description at <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1dLJigo\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;1dLJigo<\/a> - The sky&#x27;s the limit!<\/p><p>Finally, if anyone in San Francisco is looking to make a few extra dollars part-time, Rinse is hiring part-time Associates to help us deliver clothes. We pay $25 per hour for a handful of hours per week. Perhaps it would be a way for some of you bootstrapping startups to earn a little extra cash?

We turn out products, about 3-4 per year, based on our own ideas. The ones that go well, we reinvest in. Those that don&#x27;t, we bury in the yard. We also invest in, mentor, and incubate local startups targeting the Latin American market. We&#x27;re at the center of the rapidly emerging startup boom in Mexico. Mostly though, we have a lot of fun.<\/p><p>We&#x27;re giving a few developers the opportunity to rethink their life priorities and get out of Dodge for a while. You&#x27;re startup is flagging? Sick of the fog? Commute got you down? Just broke up with your partner? Why not pull the rip cord and come work with us for a while?<\/p><p>What do we have to offer?\n* A vibrant, biggish (pop. 4M), student-oriented city, that&#x27;s full of hip bars, restaurants, and (really) beautiful, friendly people.\n* A work environment that is, hands down, the hippest place to work in Mexico. Imagine programming in the hammock - poolside (yes, we have a pool).\n* Use of the beach house. We have a 3 story beach house with all mod cons, 20 feet from a graceful, immaculate sandy bay in a small fishing village. Also, one of the premier left point surf breaks is 5 minutes away by boat (which we also have).\n* A chance to learn (or practice your Spanish).\n* An opportunity to be at ground zero for one of the most vibrant and rapidly expanding startup scenes in the world.\n* Beef up your resume with experience in navigating the business climate in Mexico and Latin America.\n* and, finally, ALMOST NO MONEY. Okay, not entirely true - you&#x27;ll be paid a very tidy wage (by mexican standards) which will allow you to live well here - most things are cheap here. However, if you compare what you&#x27;ll make here versus what you&#x27;re making now? It will be a disappointing exercise. Said differently, if money is what you&#x27;re after - then this is not for you. If you&#x27;re looking for adventure, fun, and to challenge your self with something new - welcome to your new home!!!<\/p><p>Who are we looking for?

But don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t know these. As long as you have a very solid command of at least one programming language (Java, C, C++, Python, etc) and are smart as a whip, we can teach you the rest. We expect the same things that any software development shop would: ability to write clean, well-documented code, familiarity with Dev Environments (Xcode, CodeIgniter&#x2F;Play&#x2F;Angular&#x2F;etc.), experience with Agile&#x2F;Scrum concepts, etc. Culturally we look for self-starters that can thrive with very little guidance and who have a genuine passion of solving complex problems. You should also like beer (or not be afraid to watch others consume large quantities of it), music, the sun, and tacos.) Oh yes, and a sense of humor - you&#x27;ll want to bring that too.\nYou want to know more? Of course you do. Check out the site: www.agavelab.com or drop us an email.

The platform will aim to help teachers assess student work, such as essays or journals, and improve student writing through feedback during the revision and editing process.<\/p><p>Our web services are built in Python using the Django framework, and our backend is powered by state-of-the-art machine learning implemented in Java. Our team has a strong technical background and a history of work in education. In this position, you\u2019ll be implementing a rich web application using client-side frontend frameworks. Your role will be to bridge the gap between our RESTful API for writing assessment and our wireframed user workflows for student and teacher access to these tools.<\/p><p>This job will be highly collaborative in an early-stage, self-funded and profitable startup. Your primary responsibilities will focus on frontend development, but you\u2019ll occasionally dive into our Python web services and collaborate on defining our user workflows including UX and visual design. Dependent on interest and experience, you may be asked to contribute to the Java machine learning software that powers our platform.<\/p><p>No experience with machine learning or natural language processing is necessary or expected, but you need to be eager and interested in finding out how those tools work and how they can help students and teachers. You\u2019ll be working under the guidance of experienced researchers from Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Language Technologies Institute and Human-Computer Interaction Institute.<\/p><p>We prefer an on-site employee at our office in Pittsburgh, PA, but may make exceptions for an outstanding candidate. Compensation will be competitive and based on experience.<\/p><p>Skills and Requirements<\/p><p>Ideal candidates will have an active interest in educational technology, are interested in using machine learning for real-world benefit, and have prior experience including the following:<\/p><p>* Rich web application development using JavaScript frameworks like Angular, Ember, or Backbone.<\/p><p>* Web layout and implementation of frontend page design using HTML and CSS.<\/p><p>* Designing and working with RESTful APIs providing complex functionality to frontend applications.<\/p><p>* Agile development on a small, dynamic team.<\/p><p>You might also bring other wonderful things to the table, such as:<\/p><p>* Experience with deployment and continuous integration on Amazon Web Services or another cloud host.<\/p><p>* Live support and operations management for large-scale customer-facing web services.<\/p><p>* Development experience for web MVC frameworks, especially using Python with Django.<\/p><p>* A background in educational technology or enthusiasm about helping people improve their writing.<\/p><p>* Prior real-world experience with machine learning applications.<\/p><\/font>",

That&#x27;s a simple statement, but if you dig deeper, there&#x27;s a lot to it. It says that we think they&#x27;re smart. And that we could learn from them. And that they could learn from us. And that we get along, and they fit our culture. And they&#x27;re passionate about our product like we are. And of course - that they also want to work with us.<\/p><p>Our interviews are fun - at least we think so. They&#x27;re largely modeled after largely after Google interviews (there&#x27;s a lot of Google interviewing experience in our team). Questions are either real problems we&#x27;ve had to solve (probably recently) or some abstractification of a bigger problem to see how you attack problems in general (with the &quot;getting the right answer&quot; not being the interesting part of the interview).<\/p><p>Specifically - We&#x27;re looking for:<\/p><p>Backend Developers:<\/p><p>You&#x27;re a crackshot in your backend language of choice. As I said, we&#x27;re building a system that does an incredible amount of work all while the user is waiting for it to complete - so needless to say, we&#x27;re looking for people who care about performance. A lot.<\/p><p>Our backend is a highly concurrent system written in Java using MongoDB. You might know Java or you might not, but either way you&#x27;re willing to learn. If you don&#x27;t know it - you can impress us in your language of choice. You understand algorithms matter. You also understand sloppy database access could make that ugly n^2 algorithm look absolutely blazing fast.<\/p><p>You love to code. You love to show off your results now and then to other engineers (as they&#x27;re probably the only folks around who might get the intracacies of what you&#x27;re excited about)<\/p><p>We&#x27;re looking for both Senior and Junior backend engineers. If you&#x27;re a Senior Engineer - you&#x27;ve worked in server-side code for a few years. You&#x27;ve scaled to thousands or millions of users.  You can talk to other Senior engineers with very few words because you both know the special cases, assumptions, and pitfalls cold.<\/p><p>If you&#x27;re a Junior engineer, you love to code and you&#x27;re good at it. But most importantly - Be smart. Be passionate. Be excited.  (New grads please apply!)<\/p><p>Android and IOS engineers:<\/p><p>You have apps in the store you can show us. You care about the user experience.  You have a few years under your belt in either Objective-C or Android-Java.<\/p><\/font>",

We love the feeling of getting an idea, exploring some hypotheses, and finding a surprising story in the data. And we love enabling others to have that feeling. So we\u2019re creating the modern data analysis tool, so anyone can get as much value out of their data as a trained expert, and experts can get their insight much faster.<\/p><p>Most statistical analyses are conceptually simple, but existing software requires an unnecessarily large amount of statistical knowledge to ask simple questions. And even experts find these tools time-consuming and painful to use. So most people fall back to the much less powerful Excel (and its PivotTables), spending their time shuffling data around an interface that\u2019s barely changed in 15 years. Statwing democratizes data analysis by making statistics easier to use and interpret than even Excel.<\/p><p>Our investors include Y Combinator, Jeff Hammerbacher (cofounded Cloudera, coined the term &quot;Data Science&quot;, built the Facebook data team) and Jason Seats (cofounded Slicehost, runs TechStars Cloud).<\/p><p>We&#x27;re hiring.

Students choose what to build based on their own requirements for a software agent to help make their PCs more productive. The first prototype of Inck will be released on Jan 14th, 2014 to students at a local high tech institute.<\/p><p>Inck is written in C for the (old) Windows platform. Your work, to start with, will mostly involve programming. Over time, as you internalize the product idea, you will become more involved with product definition and the productization process (higher level stuff).<\/p><p>We pay you a market rate salary and upon successful completion of a six month probation process, we give you 1% equity in the company. We work a 36 hour, six hours a day, six day work week. Our work environment is intense and challenges you to grow. Allahabad is a laid back town with an academic tilt. This position provides you an opportunity to learn a lot of good engineering while at the same time share in the success of a new company. You will be working with a founder, CEO with over 20 years of experience in the industry and excellent academic and professional credentials.<\/p><p>To apply, go through our website, then send me an email at rohit@khitchdee.com.

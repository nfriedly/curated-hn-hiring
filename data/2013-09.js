We've recently hired an ACM fellow, as well as a new college grad.<p>Of course Google is hiring. So, why I posting this? Every time I tell someone I'm working at Google in Madison, they're shocked that there's an office in Madison, and I often hear people complaining about the lack of interesting technical work in Madison. There's fun technical work in Madison, I promise.</p><p>I'm working on a hardware/software co-design project that's attacking a fundamentally hard problem, which started as a 20%-time project. There are a couple other hardware projects in the office; most hardware projects start as prototypes of crazy ideas, and go from there. The majority of people here are doing low-level systems programming, usually networking related, and a handful of people are doing data analysis (call it big data, if you like) to figure out how to optimize Google's next generation hardware and software platforms. I'm sorry I can't describe projects in much more detail -- Google is pretty secretive about what goes into datacenters.</p><p>The office is small (just under 30 people), and manages to avoid any bureaucracy you might expect from a big company. The work is interesting enough that in the five year history of the office, only one person has left (and he retired to a ranch in Nebraska). Feel free to email me (see profile) if you have any questions.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&amp;jid=45087&amp;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&amp;jid=45087&amp;</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&amp;jid=2069001&amp;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&amp;jid=2069001&amp;</a></p></font><p><font color=\"#000000\">Edit: Interesting to see this downvoted. If you're downvoting this, I'd be curious to know why. Because Madison is in the middle of nowhere and you don't care about Madison? Because you don't like big companies? Because you're cynically trying to push your job post above this one? Because you think job postings need bullet points?</font></p><p><font size=\"1\"><u><a href=\"reply?id=6310343&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%33%31%30%32%33%34\">reply</a></u></font></p></span>",

We're an edtech startup with funding some of the biggest names in the valley (Jeff Clavier, Ron Conway, General Catalyst, Mitch Kapor...), and we're one of the fastest growing education companies of all time. We're the only non-YC company that Paul Graham has ever invested in. We've built a product that makes a real difference and gets huge engagement with millions of kids, and we're about to take it to the next level, hopefully with you on board. We have a strong team, an extremely comfortable and relaxed environment and great salary + benefits. If you're a strong hacker who wants to use JavaScript to change the world, apply here:</p><p></p><pre><code>  --------------------------\n\n  https://classdojo.wufoo.com/forms/join-classdojo/  \n\n  --------------------------    \n</code></pre>\nOr email jobs@classdojo.com. You can read about the work and environment here: <a href=\"http://www.classdojo.com/jobs\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.classdojo.com/jobs</a><p>--------------------------</p><p>We're particularly looking for:</p><p></p><pre><code>  * Frontend Engineer  \n</code></pre>\n--------------------<p>What's the role?</p><p>--------------------</p><p>At the core of ClassDojo is a node.JSON API built on node.js which makes use of multiple services and handles hundreds of requests per second. The frontend web application talks to this API, and it's a single page app that uses our own (soon to be open-sourced) JS framework - mojo.js - which combines the best bits of Backbone, Ember and Angular. That means great templating with powerful and efficient data-binding, but plenty of flexibility to build apps quickly. You'll work on this and other awesome tools, and you'll build a lot of user-facing features that go out to millions of kids around the world every day. It's pretty rare to have impact like this, and as much freedom as we'll give you.</p><p>Everyone on our team agrees that this is the most exciting phase of the company that we've seen, and we're growing so quickly that we're all very eager to meet and work with you!</p><p>--------------------</p><p>What skills are we looking for?</p><p>--------------------</p><p>* This is primarily an engineering role, rather than being design or CSS focused. We'd like you to be really strong on JavaScript fundamentals, up-to-date with modern JS engineering, and familiar with advanced DOM manipulation.\n* Having said that, some minimal design chops would be cool...\n* ...but not essential. We do have designers.\n* A good sense of product and a desire to have a creative role in designing product features is important to us.\n* You love building things well and building them quickly - like us!</p><p>The best way to show this off is to point to things you've built. We'd love to see personal projects which demonstrate the above.</p></font><p><font color=\"#000000\">Is this you?

This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the web’s most innovative and exciting services. You’ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.</p><p>IFTTT’s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We’ve built a system that enables users to set up simple “if this, then that”-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 60 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.</p><p>We're well funded, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. We’re hoping you can be the next one.</p><p>==================================</p><p>Mobile Engineer</p><p>Earlier this summer we released our first mobile app, IFTTT for iPhone (<a href=\"https://ifttt.com/mobile\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ifttt.com/mobile</a>). The response has been overwhelmingly positive (Editor's Choice, #1 Productivity). We're looking for talented mobile developers who can help us continue to innovate on iPhone, as well as bringing IFTTT to new platforms (Android, wearable computing, embedded systems, etc).</p><p>==================================</p><p>Platform Engineer</p></font><p><font color=\"#000000\">We’re hoping to find candidates who speak fluently about distributed architectures, databases, and ops, who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and writing code at all levels of the stack, and who have the confidence and depth of knowledge to take ownership of long-term projects. IFTTT currently runs on a polyglot mix of technologies, including EC2, Rails, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and Chef. Experience with these is a big plus, but we’re constantly evolving, and we value creative problem-solving and desire to learn over domain knowledge.</font></p><p><font size=\"1\"><u><a href=\"reply?id=6310701&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%33%31%30%32%33%34\">reply</a></u></font></p></span>",

We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss. Hardware like this has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more.

We make your notes and to do lists better, not just better organized.<p>We have a really simple and effective product for keeping track of reminders, ideas, etc., but what I think is really exciting about our business is the R&amp;D we're doing to automate those things or find relevant context/information.</p><p>For example, you write down a book you want to look up, and we show you where you can find it. You have a grocery list, we let you know when you're within a block of a store that has those items. The possibilities are endless, and there's just as much product strategy that needs to be determined there as there is code. But we believe that productivity software can do so much more than empower the procrastination they do today.</p><p>Looking to add engineers with experience in mobile development (Android in particular), JavaScript (we use Angular, but experience with another framework like Backbone or Ember will suffice), machine learning and natural language processing. As far as NLP goes, we're doing some really unique things that involve more statistics than typical NLP toolkits, so a good stats background will be helpful.</p><p>Backed by TechStars Boston and a group of fantastic angel investors and venture capitalists, we're a young, close-knit and energetic team of 6 who believe that simple products, engineered properly, can make a big impact on people's lives. We hang out after work frequently, have dinner together at least weekly, and are genuinely friends (not just co-workers). After big releases, we'll usually take the day off to do something fun like laser tag or kayaking. I believe in hiring people that I want to work with over the course of a career, not just for a particular role today. At the end of every interview I ask myself, \"In 10 years, will I regret not having had the opportunity to work with this person?\"</p><p>Also, we were #2 on Hacker News last year when we accidentally called 2,000 people bitches: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3557813\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3557813</a></p></font><p><font color=\"#000000\">Sound interesting?

No Remote.<p><i>Merchant Relations 3 Month Internship</i></p><p>UpOut is a discriminating guide to the best weird parties, underground culture and unique happenings in your city. Our mission is to help make that epic night out, perfect first date or relaxing afternoon happen. We are a small passionate team started by two best friends in their dorm room. We've been through Tandem's incubator and are backed by some of Silicon Valley's best investors.</p><p>What You'll Do\nSince the early days of UpOut, we've worked to help the culture maestros of San Francisco, the event organizers. These awesome people put together the events and activities that define the culture of our beautiful city. As part of the Merchant Relations Team, you'll focus on building strong lasting relationships with local merchants. You will work directly with merchants to help make their events amazing. Although your core competency will be in creating persuasive promotion campaigns, you'll also use our vast event expertise to advise them in their event making decisions. Your core responsibilities will be:</p><p>- Advise event organizers. You'll be working one on one with event organizers suggesting better event names, images and putting together promotion plans.\n - Learn and perform analysis. Use data to build better processes within the Merchant Relations team. You'll be able to affect the tools we build, the process and more.\n - Research the event business. Read, think and write about the event industry to get insider insights into the business. Of course, you'll also go to a ton of events.</p><p>You have great communication skills, attention to detail and boatloads of creativity. You're that friend who plans for everyone else. Previous sales experience is a huge plus. You're hungry to learn more and think that a small (but fast growing) team is the best place to do that.</p><p>This is a paid full time 3 month internship (2 weeks training + 10 weeks work). A full time position may be offered at the end of the internship based on performance.</p></font><p><font color=\"#000000\">Please apply at <a href=\"http://www.jobscore.com/jobs/upoutinc/merchant-relations-intern/dRhbrCeRmr440SeJe4e_S2\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.jobscore.com/jobs/upoutinc/merchant-relations-int...</a></font></p><p><font size=\"1\"><u><a href=\"reply?id=6311148&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%33%31%30%32%33%34\">reply</a></u></font></p></span>",

If this sounds interesting let me know (ragalie@verbasoftware.com)</p><p>=========</p><p>About us:</p><p>The college textbook market is currently being disrupted. Verba helps colleges and universities transform themselves so that they a) embrace the power of transparency and the internet, b) become agents of change in the textbook industry instead of agents of reaction and c) continue to make approximately the same profit margin from course material sales.</p><p>About 300 colleges and universities use our applications to acquire low-cost inventory and price textbooks competitively. Then millions of students visit our white-labeled sites to transparently compare the bookstore's offers against online competitors, and around 80% of students choose to buy from their local bookstore.</p><p>We're looking for people familiar with some of Ruby, Rails, Clojure, MySQL and JS who can help us grow faster. We have a great team, embrace new technologies (we just switched to Puma, we're moving to the JVM so we can use Netflix's Hystrix project to reduce API-related downtime), but also care a lot about producing and maintaining a stable, solid product for our customers.</p><p>The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end. Additional pluses are a stats background, experience with Hadoop and knowledge of scheduling algorithms.</p></font><p><font color=\"#000000\">You can check out our website (<a href=\"http://www.verbasoftware.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.verbasoftware.com</a>) to read about our current products and hear people say nice things about us. :)</font></p><p><font size=\"1\"><u><a href=\"reply?id=6311352&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%33%31%30%32%33%34\">reply</a></u></font></p></span>",

Our primary product, Moka5 Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into \"layers\", so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it's running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you're not on the LAN. We also do a bunch of security work to make it reasonable to run a corporate VM on your personal machine: this way, you're not stuck carrying two laptops around.</p><p>One product that's been seeing lots of growth is Moka5 BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into Moka5 Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don't have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We're also writing iOS and Android apps for remotely accessing your files on the go (even when you don't have a network connection), and currently getting ready to release a client-side encrypted filesystem for synchronizing your files between your desktop and mobile device. There's also quite a bit of work on the server side -- you get to solve fun problems about reliability, scalability, and geographic redundancy, but since we sell a product and not a service, nobody on our team has to carry a pager and get woken up to fix things for customers.</p><p>We're not per se a virtualization company: we don't write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems, file systems, virtualization, or networking, come talk to us. If dynamic-linker trickery sounds like your idea of fun, we'll get along well. We work in C++ and C# on the desktop, J2EE on the server, and the native languages (Objective-C and Java) on mobile; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream.</p></font><p><font color=\"#000000\">See moka5.com for more info, and send me an email (gthomas at that domain name) if you're interested!</font></p><p><font size=\"1\"><u><a href=\"reply?id=6311399&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%33%31%30%32%33%34\">reply</a></u></font></p></span>",

In our previous work as tutors, we realized just how awful of a process it is to try to advertise and market tutoring services on one's own. It is even worse for the students looking for tutors. There is simply nowhere for them to go. Search Twitter for \"math tutor\" and you'll see just how many kids go without tutors because the simply can't find or afford them. It's a classic problem of an inefficient market.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------</p><p>The position is for a front-end engineer INTERN (REMOTE is OK). Our stack includes Python/Django, Javascript/jQuery, and Bootstrap. We have no prerequisite on experience, and only require that you are a smart, creative hacker who can write simple, elegant code.

That statement of fast growth might sound cliched, but our revenues grew by 210% (yes!) last month and we have a ton of enterprise deals in the pipeline to keep up that momentum.</p><p>Meanwhile, we also launched a new product (hackerrank.com) to create a community of programmers in different domains of Computer Science - AI, ML, Image processing, security, etc. The aim is to build a place to get every problem solver in the world and add an engaging layer on the top - contests, jobs, prizes, office hours (Eg: hackerrank.com/quora) from companies who are our customers already.</p><p>2 years from now you can imagine us to be in a position to have 20-30k technology companies using our recruit product and 100-150k active programmers on hackerrank making it effectively a hugely powerful platform to connect programmers with right opportunities (jobs, contests, cash prizes to solve real-world problems, learning a new domain, inventing a new technique to solve a problem and many more) in the fastest way. And when this happens, it will help ship products faster thus accelerating the pace of the world.</p><p>It's a tough mission ahead but we are all geared up. Everyone is so passionate and hardworking that sometimes from an external view, you might find it hard to differentiate a founder from an employee.</p><p>Both the products are built by the same team and we are hiring for all the roles - PM, hacker, sales, marketing (hackerrank.com/careers)</p></font><p><font color=\"#000000\">E-mail me: vivek [at] interviewstreet (or) vivek [at] hackerrank if you'd like to know more.</font></p><p><font size=\"1\"><u><a href=\"reply?id=6311690&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%33%31%30%32%33%34\">reply</a></u></font></p></span>",

But if you are hungry for challenges in the intersection of Big Data / Machine Learning. Talk to us. Contact me at dominiek at bottlenose dot com (Recruiters NOT OK).</p><p>Bottlenose is headquartered in LA with a large part of the development team in Amsterdam. Technologies we use: Cassandra, Storm, Hadoop, MongoDB, Node.js.</p><p>Our Vision:</p><p>The Stream. It's what matters now. From email to tweets, from forum postings to customer complaints, from enterprise social to automated systems monitors, the drivers for business are now in vortex of voices reflecting markets, internal morale, innovation, brand equity, product acceptance, politics and threats. Rational intend has shifted to irrational actions. Understanding the past bares no guarantee for the future. Understanding what's actionable in streams after-the-fact is expensive. Even dangerous.</p><p>This new paradigm requires new tools and methods that can make sense out of the stream and understand human emotion. Bottlenose’s core technology - StreamSense -  creates a virtual mind map of everything people pay attention to. It is a new kind of database to derive powerful new insights. StreamSense gives organizations the emotional intelligence that they didn’t have before. It allows them to sense what people are feeling and to anticipate the unknown unknowns - both the good and the bad.</p><p>Attempts at creating machine understanding of our world like the Semantic Web and the Knowledge Graph have failed due to two fundamental flaws: 1) A model of the world is not something that should be derived from documents written by experts; 2) In order to build a ‘global brain’ you need to understand human emotion and human intend.</p></font><p><font color=\"#000000\">Bottlenose’s ultimate mission is to create a global artificial brain. This global consciousness is build out of a continuous stream of human conversation and attention. By analyzing these vast amounts of data and by analyzing the emotions around it, we build up a mental model of the world. We think this will give us a shot at creating an incredibly powerful Artificial General Intelligence.</font></p><p><font size=\"1\"><u><a href=\"reply?id=6311943&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%33%31%30%32%33%34\">reply</a></u></font></p></span>",

These places have active nightlife scenes that I know and/or quality technical talent around.</p><p>Right now the company is completely bootstrapped and I want to keep it that way for as long as possible so you’ll need to have a cash reserve. If we can get really good traction getting funding may be entertained but I’d rather raise money from customers, you should feel the same too.</p><p><i>Here’s where you come in:</i></p><p>Across the board people will need to be scrappy and not be afraid of wearing many hats.</p><p>Specific roles:</p><p>- - - -  - - - - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - - -</p><p>*  CTO / Vp Engineering</p><p>Have you built cool stuff that lots of people use?</p><p>Do you want to run you own engineering organization of really smart people and have them at your disposal to help solve problems?</p><p>I want to build from the ground up with Scala on the backend.

Curious Minds specializes in highly disruptive mobile and web applications.</p><p>We are currently looking for a talented Software Engineer with strong skills in network programming and SIP/RTP. You will build and improve our real-time SIP/RTP-based framework &amp; applications.</p><p>Qualifications:\n- Strong C/C++ programming skills\n- Strong OO &amp; multi-threaded programming skills\n- Mobile development experience\n- Network programming experience\n- SIP/RTP development experience\n- Strong debugging skills\n- Experience dealing with bandwidth and latency issues\n- Self-Motivated\n- Good design and analytical skills\n- Good communication skills\n- Passion for real-time!</p><p>Desired/Other Skills:\n- Experience with Objective-C\n- Experience with SipWise\n- Mac/iOS development (AVFoundation)\n- Windows development\n- H264 encoding/decoding\n- openGL\n- Knowledge of network security strategies\n- Android development\n- Familiar with Xamarin and PhoneGap</p><p>Product:\nShowKit is a mobile software development kit that turbo charges apps with live communication features in under 30 minutes. Before ShowKit, it would take companies and software engineers months of intensive development to add features like audio/video conferencing, screen sharing, and gesture control to their applications. Our first-to-market gesture control functionality empowers users to tap, swipe, highlight, and fully control another users’ screen remotely while simultaneously connecting the two users via audio/video conference.</p><p>Notably, ShowKit is the only framework that includes hardware accelerated video encoding &amp; decoding. This enables 720p at 30fps, the highest quality video conferencing resolution on the market, while using minimal cpu resources and allowing the app to run seamlessly in the background while a call is taking place. Comparable solutions use full cpu resources &amp; only achieve 4-5fps at that resolution, which isn’t feasible for video conferencing.</p><p>AngelList Profile: <a href=\"https://angel.co/showkit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://angel.co/showkit</a>\nShowKit Demo Videos: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/ShowKitSDK\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/user/ShowKitSDK</a></p><p>Our Office &amp; Perks:\nOur Penthouse office sits on the historic Sunset Strip with the best view of all of LA. \n- Top of the line gear\n- Kitchen stocked full of drinks and snacks\n- Friendly and down-to-earth work environment\n- Health, Dental &amp; Vision Coverage</p></font><p><font color=\"#000000\">To apply: \nSend your resume and GitHub account to anthony@showkit.com</font></p><p><font size=\"1\"><u><a href=\"reply?id=6312217&amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%33%31%30%32%33%34\">reply</a></u></font></p></span>",

The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research. 4.1m academics have joined Academia.edu, and over 300k join each month.</p><p>Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to make science faster and more open. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu:</p><p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to make publishing a button, and the distribution of scientific ideas instant.</p><p>- Better peer review. Currently two people peer review a paper, which is too small a sample size. With 50,000 people worldwide in a research community like Machine Learning, or breast cancer, what 2 people think is not statistically significant. We need a broader-based peer review process, one that surfaces the opinions from the entire scientific community.</p><p>- Data-sets. Scientists don't share their data-sets right now. The data remains stuck on their hard-drives. The main reason for this is a lack of incentives for the scientists to share their data. We need to introduce the right reputation mechanisms in science to facilitate the sharing of data. -</p><p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.</p><p>We're a 12-person engineering-driven team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb.</p><p>We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.\nWe are looking to hire software engineers to help build a faster and more open science.</p><p>There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href=\"http://academia.edu/hiring\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission here <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/</a> (The Future of Peer Review) and here <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/03/the-future-of-the-scientifi..\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/03/the-future-of-the-scientifi...</a>.

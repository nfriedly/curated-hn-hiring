This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the web\u2019s most innovative and exciting services. You\u2019ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.<\/p><p>IFTTT\u2019s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We\u2019ve built a system that enables users to set up simple \u201cif this, then that\u201d-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 70 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<\/p><p>We're well funded, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we\u2019ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. We\u2019re hoping you can be the next one.<\/p><p>==================================<\/p><p>Mobile Engineer<\/p><p>Earlier this summer we released our first mobile app, IFTTT for iPhone (<a href=\"https:\/\/ifttt.com\/mobile\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/ifttt.com\/mobile<\/a>). The response has been overwhelmingly positive (Editor's Choice, #1 Productivity). We're looking for talented mobile developers who can help us continue to innovate on iPhone, as well as bringing IFTTT to new platforms (Android, wearable computing, embedded systems, etc).<\/p><p>==================================<\/p><p>Platform Engineer<\/p><\/font><p><font color=\"#000000\">We\u2019re hoping to find candidates who speak fluently about distributed architectures, databases, and ops, who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and writing code at all levels of the stack, and who have the confidence and depth of knowledge to take ownership of long-term projects. IFTTT currently runs on a polyglot mix of technologies, including EC2, Rails, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and Chef. Experience with these is a big plus, but we\u2019re constantly evolving, and we value creative problem-solving and desire to learn over domain knowledge.<\/font><\/p><p><font size=\"1\"><u><a href=\"reply?id=6476302&amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%30%6a%32%71%4e%4d%39%75%56%55%67%51%6d%6a%6b%73%6f%4e%35%49%42%31\">reply<\/a><\/u><\/font><\/p><\/span>",

However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<\/p><p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<\/p><\/font><p><font color=\"#000000\">Please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/amacapital.net\/careers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/amacapital.net\/careers.html<\/a> to learn more, and, if interested, apply to careers@amacapital.net.<\/font><\/p><p><font size=\"1\"><u><a href=\"reply?id=6476331&amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6c%6e%69%30%69%62%69%31%47%73%6d%48%79%6f%7a%52%35%6c%55%34%66%4d\">reply<\/a><\/u><\/font><\/p><\/span>",

Think HTTP\/DB\/memcache\/NAS\/etc processing times for all the servers in a datacenter, all by passively watching the network.<\/p><p>I'm a software engineer at ExtraHop and here's why I love my job:<\/p><p>1. The team is amazing and everyone makes a difference. The two founders, Jesse and Raja, designed and built BigIP v9 when they were at F5 Networks before founding ExtraHop, and are still very much involved in engineering. It's a great working environment and we have a lot of fun.<\/p><p>2. Hard problems at all levels. We parse a bunch of different protocols at 20Gbps by writing high-performance multithreaded C and our own linux kernel drivers. Our datastore handles 200,000 inserts a second with 10MB\/s of data. Our UI has a ton of charts and tables, with data going through django and tornado. We use python, C, javascript, flex (slowly moving to a new UI with html5 + javascript), and a modified yacc+bison for some of our protocol parsers. You can hack anything from C to the front-end design and anywhere in between.<\/p><p>3. Our customers love it. It's awesome to see problems diagnosed and solved with our box.<\/p><p>jobs@extrahop.com<\/p><\/font><p><font color=\"#000000\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.extrahop.com\/company\/jobs\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/www.extrahop.com\/company\/jobs\/<\/a><\/font><\/p><p><font size=\"1\"><u><a href=\"reply?id=6476409&amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%32%33%79%4e%64%68%46%6e%66%70%52%61%76%6d%47%4b%68%4d%49%66%69%57\">reply<\/a><\/u><\/font><\/p><\/span>",

In October 2012, we acquired the design firm 80\/20 and have had New York based colleagues for some time now. Our logical next step was to bootstrap a NYC Engineering presence to tap in the growing community here. We just started building the Engineering team in July.<\/p><p>As a company, we have four main focuses.<\/p><p>Go international. We're adapting what made us successful in the US abroad. This is harder than typical international plays since it requires translating our four major benefits to small merchants: 1. Shipping readers, 2. Card payments (physical world is much more complex than online), 3. Sending money quickly to our merchants, a.k.a. settlement: very localized and next-day is hard on a number of fronts), 4. Assessing risk of merchants as they sign up, aka underwriting: again, very localized most countries do have FICO scores, SSN, D&amp;B numbers and such.<\/p><p>Move up market. One of the biggest success of Square is to have enabled merchants who were \"non-consumers\" to start accepting credit cards. In classic disruptor fashion, we have essentially alonged the long tail. We haven't been eating someone else's lunch, we've created a whole new category! Now it's time to move up to bigger merchants.<\/p><p>The other side of the counter. With Wallet, Square Market (<a href=\"http:\/\/squareup.com\/market\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/squareup.com\/market<\/a>) and Square Cash (<a href=\"http:\/\/squareup.com\/cash\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/squareup.com\/cash<\/a>), we're going on the other side of the counter and interacting directly with consumers. We think that we can provide the best experience for consumer-to-merchant and consumer-to-consumer commerce. We're at the infancy, but extremely well positioned to succeed.<\/p><p>Data as product. We're leveraging our data. We know a lot about our merchants: daily sales, seasonality, growth of their business, correlation with other events (e.g. Mapping Square Payments During the Super Bowl). Lots of innovative products are in the making which will highlight the breadth of what we do.<\/p><p>In NYC, we're starting with a focus on infrastructure, distributed systems, and money moving systems. We're a small team, located in SoHo, and defining the culture of engineering for Square on the East Coast.<\/p><\/font><p><font color=\"#000000\">If you're interested; I'd love to chat.

We strive to achieve this by delivering disruptive thinking to companies with ambitious missions, keeping technology at the heart of what we do. As a Principal Technical Consultant, you're responsible for creating and implementing cutting-edge technology solutions for our customers whilst driving software excellence to influence and shape the wider software industry as well as our business.<\/p><p>As a Principal Consultant at ThoughtWorks, here's what we'll be looking for you to bring:<\/p><p>- You love coding. Even if your recent roles have taken you away from being as hands-on as you might like, you've no doubt found other ways to keep your coding skills from getting too rusty and we expect that you'll have had exposure to recent technologies. \n- You have a rich breadth of experience and are equally comfortable talking financial projections or business process modelling as you are advocating for TDD.\n- You really understand the business context of the challenges that organisations face and distinguish yourself in the way you articulate this with clients to create and deliver robust, scalable, elegant, flexible and relevant software solutions that truly transform industries.\n- Leadership is not something you do from far away, you get the importance of taking people with you along the journey and are able to influence and coach those around you to orchestrate team success.<\/p><p>As a Principal Consultant at ThoughtWorks, here\u2019s what you can do:<\/p><p>- Directly guide the technical strategy for one of the world\u2019s largest airlines. Build out a new capability within ThoughtWorks - perhaps for Mobile, Big Data or DevOps. Explore ways to improve our business relevance for customers. Create and implement an original tech solution to manage high broadcasts for a new live sports coverage. Travel and work on high impact global P3 (pillar 3) projects in locations such as Africa or Ecuador. Deliver the new technology platform for a government agency providing tailored information to the public's needs. Speak at conferences. Influence and shape our client portfolio. Get published.<\/p><p>There's no typical day or engagement for our Principal Consultants. You might spend a few weeks with a new client on a deep technical review or a complete organisational review, helping them to understand the potential that technology has to solve their most pressing problems. On other projects, you might be acting as the architect, leading the design of technical solutions, or perhaps overseeing a programme inception to build a new product. It could be much more about getting stuck into a delivery project where you're equally happy coding and tech leading the team to implement the solution. Whatever your role the team always look to draw on your experience when things get tough and you often handle the difficult client conversations allowing the team to continue building software without undue pressure. You have great relationships with our new business team and work collaboratively to support pre-sales, meet prospective clients and ultimately influence and shape our portfolio of work.<\/p><p>You recognise that building your network is absolutely key to enable you to perform in your role - and you appreciate that it might be tough initially to find your place in our incredibly flat-structured organisation. You'll be drawing on all of your passion for technology, recent hands-on coding experience and knowledge of latest tech and industry best practices to help you gain the respect and credibility of your fellow technologists.<\/p><p>About ThoughtWorks<\/p><p>ThoughtWorks is a software company and community of passionate individuals whose purpose is to revolutionize software design, creation and delivery, while advocating for positive social change. Our clients are people and organizations with ambitious missions; we deliver disruptive thinking and technology to empower them to succeed. In our 20th year, over 2300 ThoughtWorks employees - 'ThoughtWorkers' - are currently serving clients from offices in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda, Ecuador the U.K., and the U.S.<\/p><\/font><p><font color=\"#000000\">To apply (or to look at other global opportunities) please visit <a href=\"http:\/\/join.thoughtworks.com\/apply\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:\/\/join.thoughtworks.com\/apply<\/a><\/font><\/p><p><font size=\"1\"><u><a href=\"reply?id=6476546&amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%59%39%78%55%78%6f%72%48%57%67%67%41%51%70%47%7a%42%67%57%6f%63%74\">reply<\/a><\/u><\/font><\/p><\/span>",

The test team supports all the development we do, at approximately a 2devs:1tester ratio.<\/p><p>* DBA - Our Data Team is lean and the individuals on the team wear many hats.

The industry is ripe for innovation!  We're building mobile apps, tackling scheduling and dispatch problems, and scaling a service at over 10% week-on-week growth.<\/p><p>I know 'app for laundry' is a tech clich\u00e9 right now, but we're definitely encountering real demand.  The problem is real, and we're solving it.<\/p><p>The team is very strong, with an HBS grad who grew up in a dry-cleaning family heading operations, and a Stanford GSB grad with direct consumer startup experience heading customer acquisition.  I'm Stanford CS\/EE, have built a few teams at various startups, and am just starting to build the technology and team to support this (very viable) business.<\/p><p>The tech stack is Heroku \/ Python \/ Django \/ Phonegap \/ JQuery \/ Backbone \/ Twilio currently, but obviously there is plenty of opportunity to influence technology decisions early on, and plenty of opportunity to learn new technologies as well.  We expect the next couple of hires to own entire new efforts, and have their hands in wide-ranging parts of our entire business.<\/p><p>We're looking for a Web Developer or Front-end Developer to develop interfaces for our customers, tools for our personnel, and visualizations for our managements.  Ideally, this person would also have an active role in the design process as well, either leading design or working with our contract designer.<\/p><p>We're also looking for a 'Special Ops Manager' - a 'Swiss-Army Knife' hustler who wants to join a startup on the ground-floor.  This person will use the tools we're developing in-house, and be involved in all facets of the business, including operations, marketing, social media, and any other aspect of the business that requires attention on any given day.  See job description at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/tuhisiywgf7md6u\/Rinse%20-%20Special%20Ops%20Manager%20Description%20Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/tuhisiywgf7md6u\/Rinse%20-%20Specia...<\/a><\/p><p>Finally, if anyone in San Francisco is looking to make a few extra dollars part-time, Rinse is hiring part-time Associates to help us deliver clothes.  We pay $25 per hour for a handful of hours per week.  Perhaps it would be a way for some of you bootstrapping startups to earn a little extra cash?

The Falcon launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft are among the most ambitious engineering systems in the world. Dragon holds the distinction of being the first commercially developed spacecraft to have achieved orbit, rendezvous with the International Space Station, and a safe return to Earth. SpaceX is advancing the state of the art in a field previously dominated by nation states.<\/p><p>Our next developments include a heavy lift launch vehicle, human transportation, and a reusable launch system that will drastically reduce the cost of access to space.<\/p><p>FLIGHT SOFTWARE DEVELOPER\nAs a software developer on the flight software team, you will be creating software that is used to design, develop, launch and operate SpaceX flight systems. You will engage with other SpaceX engineers to discover the needs of the mission and code highly reliable software that turns the mission into a reality. You will be responsible for the complete lifecycle of the software you create, from development to testing to operation during a mission. You will accept a large degree of personal responsibility, work on awesome stuff and every day be completely baffled as to how you ever worked anywhere else.<\/p><p>SPACEX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING\nThe flight software team is responsible for the software that runs on-board SpaceX rockets and spacecraft, but we do more than embedded software engineering: we also do simulations, distributed data management, and analysis tools used in preparation for a launch. Our problem domains span embedded, fault tolerant, flight control, web, mobile, cloud, and big data computing. The products that we develop run on low-power space computing platforms, mobile devices, desktop systems, and in data centers.<\/p><p>We are an organizationally flat group of a few dozen software engineers. Although we work on and support critical systems, you wouldn\u2019t know it from observing our office. When it comes to the code we are unrelentingly meticulous and thorough, but when it comes to people we are big on open communication, flexible hours and a casual work environment.<\/p><p>When considering you as a candidate, we won\u2019t be focused on specific experience, skills or keywords.

We have a great team, embrace new technologies (we just switched to Puma, we're moving to the JVM so we can use Netflix's Hystrix project to reduce API-related downtime), but also care a lot about producing and maintaining a stable, solid product for our customers.<\/p><p>The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end.

That means great templating with powerful and efficient data-binding, but plenty of flexibility to build apps quickly. You'll work on this and other awesome tools, and you'll build a lot of user-facing features that go out to millions of kids around the world every day.

You have a grocery list, we let you know when you're within a block of a store that has those items.

We need you to come help us build tools that help our users perform complex analysis with the click of a button.<\/p><p>My co-founder Justin was a partner at a private equity firm that invested into apartments across the USA.  It is from his frustrations there that our product was born.  I built a few large social media analytics tools, mobile games, and a number of analytics tools for other industries.  Our engineering team is 3 people right now, we would like to add 2 more people by January 2014.<\/p><p>We use Python\/Django for our backend, and Coffeescript with Backbone\/Marionette for the frontend application.

Academia.edu's goal is to fix the problems in science so that science becomes faster and more open. We want to get every science pdf ever written on the internet, accessible for free.<\/p><p>Academia.edu is a platform where a scientist can share their research with their followers, and track how many people are reading their research, and from which countries. These metrics help move the needle for scientists when they apply for jobs and grants, and motivate them to share more of their work.<\/p><p>A leading climate scientist in Germany wrote \"Academia.edu shows the impact of your work that is not covered by Web of Science and citation indexes of that sort. With Web of Science you only learn how many people have quoted what. But with Academia.edu I can see what is viewed, what is actually read or not. Here I learn something additional, something I would not know otherwise.\u201d<\/p><p>4.5 million academics have signed up to Academia.edu, and around 1 million join every 3 months. Currently scientists have uploaded 1.6m papers, of the 57 million papers ever published. The number of papers on Academia.edu is doubling every 7 months. Come and help us get to 57 million papers.<\/p><p>Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes \"We believe open science is really important.

We want your help scaling our thousands of events per second and terabytes of data. If you're a fan of distributed systems and like to stress-test a new database every other week, you'll fit right in. And it won't hurt if you like streams, trying out ES6 features, and open-sourcing your work.<\/p><p>Our entire backend runs on Node, with a sprinkling of Redis, Mongo, and RabbitMQ. We're open to running a variety of languages and could still use someone to show our Go and Erlang libraries some love.<\/p><p>Think that might tickle your fancy? We've got a few projects in the pipeline that you can sink your teeth into right away:<\/p><p>Live Debugger\nYou'll build a system that helps developers debug requests to the Segment.io API, and whether the request has been successfully routed to all its destinations. The fun part of this one is working at a variety of scale (isn't it always?). You'll have to build a system which helps devs debug on localhost, but also help them monitor production environments sending 500 requests a second.<\/p><p>MapReduce for All\nWe'd love to have a way for developers to query the terabytes of analytics data stored in the Segment.io data warehouse. Can you streamline the process until your mother can submit mapreduce queries with ease?<\/p><p>Data Export APIs\nPerhaps you'd like to build an API to export analytics data from Amazon S3 (or maybe even Glacier?). Exporting will have to stream terabytes of data without waking our ops guys in the middle of the night. Then, you'll deploy the system to EC2 and test it, and announce it to the world!<\/p><p>To apply, email us at jobs+backend@segment.io with:<\/p><p><\/p><pre><code>  - a description of your own favorite software project (code is a bonus)\n  - a link to your Github (if you have one)\n  - what languages and frameworks you like to use, and why\n  - any bash command you'd probably use to inspect a logfile\n\n<\/code><\/pre>\n-----<p>Mobile Engineer<\/p><p>With our new iOS and Android SDKs we want to change the mobile analytics game. The market is flooded with new mobile analytics startups, but underneath they all collect the same data. And anytime you make an analytics change, you have to re-submit your app to the app store. Bummer. :'(<\/p><p>Developers can drop in our SDK and then later enable any of Segment.io\u2019s dozens of analytics integrations without writing additional code or even submitting updates to the app store. Both iOS and Android SDKs are open source, so you'll be working closely with the rest of the community (and get a great chance to show off your work).<\/p><p>Here's some examples of what you'd probably tackle at Segment.io:<\/p><p>Best New Tools\nAs the maintainer of the SDKs, you'd have total control over which analytics tools get added and distributed across millions of devices. What are the best new tools? Something for an interesting new app category? Help our users find the best-in-breed mobile analytics tools, and build them into the SDKs so that they can enable them instantly.<\/p><p>Community Distribution\nAs Segment.io's mobile expert, you'll be guiding (and helping write!) lots of the mobile content marketing we produce. We want you to become the world's leading expert on mobile analytics, knowing the business models, industry, tools and problems inside and out. We'll help propel you to become a thought leader in a brand new field.<\/p><p>Xbox, Playstation, Roku\nYou could also play around on new platforms, bringing analytics bliss to the home entertainment world and gaming platforms.<\/p><p>To apply, email us at jobs+mobile@segment.io with:<\/p><p><\/p><pre><code>  - a description of an app you worked on (code is a bonus)\n  - a link to your Github if you have one\n  - the most interesting mobile SDK you've worked with and why\n\n<\/code><\/pre>\n-----<p>Customer Engineer<\/p><p>At Segment.io, customer support drives the focus of the entire team. We're looking for a hungry engineer (don't worry, we'll feed you) who approaches customer support with an analytical efficiency. You'll keep finding new ways to improve the product, libraries, and docs wherever it's needed. For most of our users, you'll be the face of the company. Are you suave, courteous, and patient? :)<\/p><p>You'll be responsible for analyzing our richest source of data: support requests. \"Where is support coming from? Why do customers need help? Which parts of the product need the most love?\" You'll be in charge of automating as much of that as possible without sacrificing quality.<\/p><p>Currently we get about 40 support requests per day. Here's the breakdown:<\/p><p>35% are variations of \"thanks your product is super awesome!\" which are fun.\n25% are technical support requests for our main javascript library. You might have to jump on Skype with a Ukrainian developer or a Japanese designer (watch the timezone!) or maybe run down the street to help a local startup.\n15% are technical problems with our mobile libraries for iOS and Android.\n10% require debugging a server-side integration: Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, .NET, or Node.\n5% are completely confused, but we still &lt;3 them.\nand the remaining 10% are hiring, sales and other random inquiries.\nThis kind of analysis should feel natural to you!<\/p><p>Your analysis of support issues, feature requests, and customer feedback will be absolutely critical to planning tasks with the rest of the team. We want to make sure we're all building things that will benefit our customers.<\/p><p>Segment.io's support team also educates our customers on how the product works. You'll chat with marketers, data scientists, developers, and business owners from all over the world to help make their analytics amazing.<\/p><p>To apply, email us at jobs+customer@segment.io with:<\/p><p><\/p><pre><code>  - a description of your own favorite software project (code is a bonus)\n  - a link to your github (if you have one)\n  - think of the last time you taught someone something technical, what was it?<\/code><\/pre><\/font><\/span>",

Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not. Our developers are generalising specialists whose typical day may include refining an algorithm, writing a tricky integration test, tuning a SQL query, and discussing feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we'd like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who'd like to join us; we're hiring for all technical roles.<\/p><\/font><p><font color=\"#000000\">Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is one of the UK's leading private shopping clubs, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts.

But advertising keeps the web free (as in beer), and we want to keep the internet free. So rather than hating on advertising, we decided to do something about it.<\/p><p>At SocialWire, we are taking a new approach to advertising: building a recommendation engine for ads. Our system generates product-level ads and hyper-targets them to exactly the right audience. We do this at scale and automatically across a retailer's entire catalog. We want our ads to be so good that people discover interesting products through them, and find them to actually be useful.<\/p><p>We're looking for a full-stack engineer to join our small and talented team. As our fifth engineer, you'll have the opportunity to work on and shape all aspects of our product, from backend Python services to slick dashboard features in JavaScript. We work at the intersection of distributed machine learning and data warehousing, we like to experiment and take risks, and our engineers choose what they build. Most features are live in production just hours after they're completed. We push early and often (with testing and code review!). We ask tough questions. We get shit done.<\/p><p>Super sharp team, early stage company, awesome investors, huge opportunity, beautiful office, and interesting engineering\/research challenges.

Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines.

Before ShowKit, it would take companies and software engineers months of intensive development to add features like audio\/video conferencing, screen sharing, and gesture control to their applications. Our first-to-market gesture control functionality empowers users to tap, swipe, highlight, and fully control another users\u2019 screen remotely while simultaneously connecting the two users via audio\/video conference.<\/p><p>Notably, ShowKit is the only framework that includes hardware accelerated video encoding &amp; decoding.

Our members include some of the world\u2019s premier financial exchanges, trading firms, data centers and cloud providers. We are bringing transparency and trust to a $350B market that is fragmented to hell and dominated by middlemen ripping off enterprises that don\u2019t know the true value of their infrastructure.<\/p><p>We\u2019re hiring for several technical and non-technical roles:<\/p><p>* Senior Engineer - build the beating heart of a commodities exchange in the cloud<\/p><p>* Front-end Developer - build the front-end infrastructure of the exchange<\/p><p>* Mobile Developer - bring consumer-level ease and beauty to datacenter management<\/p><p>* Data Scientist - help refine the predictive Kelley Blue Book of IT<\/p><p>* Technical Writer - help us show how and why commoditization will reshape the industry, speed up innovation, save billions and reduce e-waste<\/p><p>We\u2019ve raised $3.3MM in funding and pay top of market, plus equity. We are not buying eyeballs in hopes of selling them later. We are attacking massive market inefficiencies and generating extremely healthy margins. We are both riding and driving a huge change in the way IT infrastructure is bought, used and sold.<\/p><p>We're pragmatists, not purists. We\u2019ve bought into reality, whatever that might be, not married to our ideas. You'll fit in best if you are as well. We\u2019re seasoned veterans with big wins and big, educational losses under our belts. We try to use the right technology for the job, with familiarity being a tie breaker. We\u2019re not religious about platforms. Some things we use today: Node.js, ElasticSearch, Asgard, Redis and CouchDB and a slew of AWS services.<\/p><\/font><p><font color=\"#000000\">If any of that sounds interesting, please email me directly at benblair@markitx.com<\/font><\/p><p><font size=\"1\"><u><a href=\"reply?id=6479581&amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%53%64%6b%36%78%48%79%53%6f%34%73%68%4d%4d%37%38%55%68%45%30%31\">reply<\/a><\/u><\/font><\/p><\/span>",

In all cases you'll be working closely with the a senior engineer and either senior corporate management or a business unit in TV, film, or news.  A typical week might look like this:<\/p><p>* Meet with the head of sales for a UK TV channel, learn about a problem they're facing trying to get an accurate value for advertisement slots.<\/p><p>* Discuss what you learned with the rest of team.  Someone suggests that a nearest-neighbors regression on data from the marketing team might help.<\/p><p>* A senior dev helps you implement the algorithm and a UI for the sales team to use it.<\/p><p>* Spend some time with the sales team to see if it's creating any value, look for improvements.<\/p><p>What we use (We list this to tell you what we're like, not to tell you what languages we expect to see on a CV):<\/p><p>* Racket.  We're big fans lisp and functional programming.<\/p><p>* Bash.  We create a lot of value with small dirty hacky shell scripts, and we aren't shy about it.<\/p><p>* Whatever gets the job done, and whatever we think might be fun to use.  Python, R, Javascript, Hadoop, EC2.  We even wrote code in Fortran once (we don't like to talk about it.)<\/p><p>Who we're looking for:<\/p><p>Most importantly, you should be an intelligent problem solver who wants to apply whatever programming and maths knowledge you have to real world problems. We're not fussed about what languages are on your CV.<\/p><p>You have some familiarity with functional programming, machine learning, and linux\/bash scripting, and you're eager for a chance to use it on real-world problems with support from other programmers.  Given the predictive modeling angle, you're probably studying or have studied maths, stats, or even physics.<\/p><p>These are <i>two<\/i> assistant\/internship positions for students looking for experience while doing their degree.
